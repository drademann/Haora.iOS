# Haora

*Time tracking app*

Haora is a small app for iPhones to record working times. The project is a so called "pet project". I use it to learn Swift programming, but it should have some use as well. As a Software Craftsman of an IT company I have to remember my working times on different projects, so came the idea for the project.
